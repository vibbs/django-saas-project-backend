# django-tenants


This package is very powerful for implementing multi-tenancy in Django applications. It allows you to create a SaaS application where each tenant has its own schema in the database, enabling data isolation and organization-specific customizations.

This also supported many of the thins which I wanted to implement in my SaaS application, such as:
- Subdomain-based routing for tenants
- Organization-specific data models
- Tenant-aware middleware for request processing
- Schema migrations for each tenant

But while implementing this package, I found some limitations and challenges:
- The documentation can be a bit sparse, especially for advanced use cases.
- The package requires careful management of migrations, as each tenant's schema needs to be kept in sync with the base schema.
- There are some performance considerations when dealing with a large number of tenants, as each tenant's schema adds overhead to database operations.

Also the whole point of building this vas-dj-saas-project is to have a boilerplate for building SaaS applications, and I wanted to keep it as simple as possible. So I decided to implement a custom multi-tenancy solution using middleware and organization-aware models instead of using django-tenants.
